 Project Description:

The Weather Dashboard is a web-based application that allows users to view, manage, and visualize weather data. It consists of two main components: a frontend and a backend.

## Frontend:

The frontend is a user-friendly web application built using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework. Users can interact with the frontend to perform various tasks:

- **View Weather Data:** Users can browse and view weather data, including city, temperature, humidity, and recorded timestamps.

- **Add New Entries:** The application provides a form for users to add new weather data entries, which are then stored in the database.

- **Update and Delete:** Users can edit existing weather data entries, and also delete records they no longer need.

- **Interactive Charts:** The frontend includes interactive charts powered by Chart.js to visualize temperature and humidity trends over time.

- **Search Functionality:** A search feature allows users to filter weather data by city, making it easy to find specific information.

- **Integration:** The frontend integrates with the backend to fetch and display weather data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Help Section:** Users can access a help section with creative and attractive data presentation related to weather conditions.

## Backend(MYSQL):

The backend serves as the data powerhouse, managing the storage and retrieval of weather data. It's implemented using Node.js and Express, connecting to a MySQL database:

- **RESTful API:** The backend provides a RESTful API with endpoints for CRUD operations on weather records.

- **Database Connectivity:** It seamlessly connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve weather data.

- **Data Validation:** The API ensures data integrity by validating incoming requests before processing them.

- **Security:** Security measures are in place to protect data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Overall,** the Weather Dashboard Project offers an intuitive and visually appealing way to interact with weather data. Users can explore weather trends, add new data, and enjoy an informative help section. The combination of a responsive frontend and a robust backend creates a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
